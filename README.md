# ANNSCGP
Supervised Artificial Neural Network with Selective Connection based on Gene Patterns

ANNSCGP proposes a supervised Artificial Neural Network with Selective Connection based on Gene Patterns (ANN-SCGP) model using Omics-data

To start ANNSCGP, you can download Binary package named "ANNSCGP_1.0.0.zip" for Windows or Source package named "ANNSCGP_1.0.0.tar.gz" for Linux and Windows. Next, you can install this zip file in R or Rstudio. You can install it with the following R codesï¼š

```install.packages("File path/ANNSCGP_1.0.0.zip", repos = NULL, type = "win.binary")```
or
```install.packages("File path/ANNSCGP_1.0.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")```

then

```library(ANNSCGP)```
